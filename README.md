# Advanced-CSS-Portfolio

## This project is a fully developed well functional webpage that allows users to interact and easily access information. The motivation behind this project is to provide a webpage that would house important information about the developer such as an: "About Me", "Contact Information", and a "Work Gallery". These sections are designed to fully function with active links and or functions when a task is completed.

# Information gained through this project is related to flex/box, transformation, formatting, root elements, media queries, adding effective special effects.

## Usage for this page is rather simple. Upon navigating to the webpage, there is a well designed layout for the user to interact with. There are a few link options in the navigation bar that will allow the user to be directed to tht corresponding section upon click of the link. 

## The About Me section is interactive for the user to choose to show or hide the written content by simply clicking on the picture. The ability to click on the picture is pointed out with text explaining that the picture is clickable.

## The Work Gallery section is a portfolio style arrangement of projects(i.e. photos) that are linked to a designated webpage for each. Upon hovering over each picture, it enlarges by 1.5. Each photo/project is also given a title as well as a description below the title as to the language used to develop each page. Once the user is no longer hovering over an image then it returns back to normal size.

## Contact Information is the last section of this webpage. In this section, an image is added above the paragraph style information. The information is centered to the page for best visual and user friendly approach. Immediately below the contact information, two active links are listed with the corresponding icon attached beside it.

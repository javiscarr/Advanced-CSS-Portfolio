# Advanced-CSS-Portfolio

## Description 📄

This project is designed to showcase the skills and future work along with give you a little bit of information about myself. It is my intention to share this portfolio with family, friends, prospective employers/clients and or collaborators so that my experience with web development can be displayed. Although this portfolio displays samples of my work, it also demonstrates the level of my coding abilities.

Creating this portfolio has been a joy to design, as I had the ability to use my own creative drive to experiment with styling and incorporating a responsive web design.

I am super excited to learn new skills that will enhance my creative spark with new functionalities that I can add in the future. Stay tuned for what's next to come!

                        <div id="myDiv">Hello, my name is Javis Carr and I am originally from a small town in Alabama called Camp Hill. 
                            After graduating high school, I attended college at Alabama A&M University where I graduated in 2012 with a Bachelor's Degree in Industrial Technology
                            with a concentration on Graphics and Imaging Technology. Every since I was a small child, I have been fascinated with the ins and outs of technology and it's been
                            an ever growing passion of mine to someday gain all the experience that I desire to grow my skills. After successfully completing this 6-month bootcamp program, I plan
                            to gain employment where I am able to utilize the skills and knowledge that I will have gained from the projects and information taught throughout the course.
